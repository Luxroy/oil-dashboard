## 🎯 The Mission
"Oil" is an experimental web application built to test a specific economic hypothesis: *Does a nation's total oil production and proven reserves reliably correlate to its national selling price?* By leveraging agentic AI to aggregate data points from the **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)** and global benchmarks like **WTI** and **Brent**, this dashboard provides a minimalist view of the global energy landscape.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React + Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Deployment:** Vercel (CI/CD via GitHub)
* **Data Sources:** EIA v2 API, Alpha Vantage

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer
**For Educational and Informational Purposes Only.** The data presented in "Oil" is aggregated from third-party APIs and may contain inaccuracies, delays, or errors. This application does not constitute financial, investment, or legal advice. The "Supply-Influence Factor" is a theoretical model and should not be used for actual market speculation or commodity trading.
